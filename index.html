                <p>Dear valued sponsor,</p>
                <p>Thank you for choosing to support us on our journey to provide the 
                    best version of Porama that we can. We appreciate your commitment to 
                    our gaming project.</p>
                <p>In order to ensure a smooth and efficient experience for all parties 
                    involved, we kindly request that you adhere to the following terms of 
                    service (ToS) when making a financial contribution to Porser:</p>
                <h3>Cancellation Policy</h3>
                <p>Should you decide to cancel your sponsorship, please inform the Porser 
                    team at least one week in advance. This will allow us to make the 
                    necessary arrangements and ensure a seamless transition.</p>
                <h3>Ownership of Funds</h3>
                <p>Porser only accepts financial contributions from funds that are legally 
                    owned by the sponsor. We do not accept funds that have been obtained
                     through illegal or unethical means, such as theft or fraud.</p>
                <h3>Third-Party ToS</h3>
                <p>When making a financial contribution via PayPal, you must accept and abide 
                    by their terms of service. The same applies when making a contribution 
                    via Ionos.</p>
                <h3>Accepted Forms of Payment</h3>
                <p>Porser only accepts financial contributions via PayPal or Ionos. We do 
                    not accept any other forms of payment at this time.</p>
                <p>We hope these ToS are clear and straightforward. If you have any 
                    questions or concerns, please do not hesitate to contact us.</p>
                <p>Best regards,</p>
                <p>Porser team</p>
